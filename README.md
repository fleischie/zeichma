## Features

### Syntax

See [example](./example) for a complete example file.

- Each paragraph is one slide.
- The content of a slide is denoted by a tab (`\t`).
- The first character (if not a tab (`\t`)) controls the markup of that slide:
    - `#`  -> Heading.
    - `=`  -> Centered (default if empty).
    - `<`  -> Left aligned.
    - `>`  -> Right aligned.
    - `@`  -> Content until first whitespace denotes an img-path to be included
              in the slide.
    - `-`  -> Content is a bullet point.
    - `\`` -> Content is monospaced.
    - `.`  -> Space (content on line is ignored).
- If the paragraph only contains a `.` an empty slide is produced.

See [example.zm](./example.zm) for a reference.

## Prior Art

Naturally this project didn't came into existance in a vacuum:

- [suckless/sent][suckless/sent] - This project is the most simple approach to
    a presentation software. It lacks certain features which would make it
    usable in the daily business.
- [tajpure/vortex][tajpure/vortex] - Electron-based Markdown presentation tool.
    A lot of extraneous features, that are really handy but not very useful for
    simple, powerful and pregnant presentation.
- [Impress][libreoffice/impress] - The pinacle of graphical presentation tools.
    Arguably too bloated and convoluted.
